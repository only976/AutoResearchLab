              "problem_statement": "Deep learning models for part recognition often fail in low-light conditions due to background noise. Traditional preprocessing pipelines are not learnable and may discard useful features.",
              "state_of_the_art": "SOTA methods use end-to-end CNNs (e.g., ResNet) but struggle with varying backgrounds. Attention mechanisms (e.g., CBAM) help but are computationally expensive.",
              "key_insight": "Design a dual-stream neural network where one stream processes edge-enhanced images, and the other suppresses background noise. The streams are fused adaptively based on illumination conditions.",
              "impact": "Expected to achieve 90% recognition accuracy in low-light conditions, with a 20% reduction in false positives compared to monolithic CNNs.",
